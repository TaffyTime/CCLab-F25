                The creature seems to be relatively peaceful. Itâ€™s chaotic movements anxiety and indecisiveness on its desired path. Its curiosity seems to overpower its anxiety, whenever one approaches the creature, it nonchalantly approaches and follows until out of its attention span. This poor little creature (the size of a sun) seems particularly sensitive to social interaction as any interaction causes him to hyperventilate and pass out briefly before coming back to his usual self

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> The Helio-Spore is a very shy creature so try not to be too loud or active when around it. If you believe in cruel and unusual treatment, you could click the creature and watch it hyperventilate and pass out for a second, but who would do that to such an adorable little guy. A nicer way to interact with this Moldy Sun is to move around and see as he curiously follows you
